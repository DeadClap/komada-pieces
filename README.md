# Komada Pieces repository

This repository contains the various *Pieces* submitted by users and collaborators.

## What are Pieces?

*Pieces* are simply parts of code that can be downloaded and installed straight
into your [Komada](https://github.com/dirigeants/komada) bot installation.

Pieces can include:

- **Commands**: Chat commands that generally respond with a message after
taking some actions.
- **Events**: Pieces that get executed when a Discord event triggers.
- **Functions**: Functions that are made available to other Pieces. These
functions can range from utility functions to blocks of code repeated enough
to justify making a function out of it. They are not seen by the members.
- **Inhibitors**: Inhibitors are pieces that run before a command is
executed and may take action on the message received, and block a command from
running in certain cases (thus *inhibit* a command).
- **Monitors**: Monitors are pieces that can run on every message, whether or
not it triggers a command. Useful for spam monitoring, swear filters, etc.
- **Providers**: Support for a specific database type. By default a very
small amount of DBs are supported, but you can extend the support by adding a
provider for whatever database you choose, and configure it to point to your
own database.
- **Finalizers**: (New in v0.20.0) Pieces that run on messages after a successful
command.
- **Extendables**: (New in v0.20.0) Pieces that act passively, attaching
new [getters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get),
[setters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set)
or [methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Method_definitions)
to the current Discord.js classes. They're executed at startup before any
other piece.
- **Packages**: A *Pieces Package* containing one or more of other pieces.
Packages are presumed to work as a single entity, meaning, custom functions
are used by commands, so are data providers, etc.
